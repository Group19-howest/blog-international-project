							<p>Hello and welcome to our blog. For our studies we have to follow an international project. We had to choose one project out of a list of 17.</p>
							<p>We all chose to go to Sweden and follow a project where we would make a website and try to secure it. At the end of that week the other participants would try and hack our website, while we would try and hack theirs. During that week we would also have some free time to sniff up a bit of Swedish culture.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, due to the global pandemic a lot of projects got cancelled. Ours was one of them. So we had to find a new project we could work on. We were given a few ideas to choose from, or we could come up with an idea ourselves. Some of the ideas we were given sounded a lot of fun, but ultimately we decided to come up with our own idea: making a cybersecurity themed capture the flag event.</p>
							<p>We chose to make a CTF because most of us had already participated multiple times in such events as a team, so it looked like a great idea to make one ourselves. It's also a bit similar to the project in Sweden, because both were cybersecurity related.</p>
