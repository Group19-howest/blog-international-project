							<h1>Testing day</h1>
							<p>In today's blog we will discuss how we started the testing fase, and how we will use the feedback.</p>
						</header>
						<div class="image main"><img src="images/blog4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>Today we started with user testing, we first let someone who is nog quite as experienced in CTF challenges as other people. We did this because we wanted to see if the challenges are possible even for someone who barely has any experience. We found out that some challenges were harder then others but they were still possible with a hint or two from us.
							So we can conclude that they are not to hard, but they can be hard when they need to.</p>
						<p>In the afternoon we worked a bit on adding extra hints where they were needed, this wasn't a lot of work since adding hints was a very easy process.
							We asked some other people who are more experienced than the first user, but they were not available today, so they will help us tomorrow where we will let them figure out the challenges with no hints from us. The only hints they will be able to use are the one we have provided on the platform. When we get feedback from them we will implement that.
							When this is all done, we will look on a productive week where we ended up with a beautiful CTF website with a lot of challenges. Some are easier, some are harder, but overall I'm pretty happy with what we have accomplished.</p>
						<p>In the evening we had a call with our coach, who gave us the idea of making a report about the user testing, this is something we will certainly do. We can use this report on the final presentation we have to do sometime in the future.
							Overall we had a productive day where we started to see a nicely finished project.</p>
