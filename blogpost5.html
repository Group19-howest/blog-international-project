						<p>The fifth and final day was quite a busy and somewhat hectic one. We started of with a recap of all the work of the previous days. Once again we altered some points and names of some challenges. For example, there were a few challenges were the name ended with 1, like "forgetful 1", where we had the intention of making a follow-up challenge. By the end of the week we had a total of 29 challenges. By our own experiences with CTF's and looking at other existing CTF events we knew that 29 challenges was by far enough, and it might even be a few challenges too much. Because of this we decided not to make any more follow-up challenges. More so, we went a step further and went over some challenges to decide if it was beneficial to keep them in the CTF. We decided to remove two challenges, putting us at a total of 27 challenges. We removed the first for its simplicity and the second for being a bit too confusing.</p>
						<p>During the day there were a few friends and fellow students that registered on our CTF. We asked them to test our challenges, so they put some time and effort into solving the challenges, as if it were a real CTF event. Most of them had some experience with cybersecurity and/or CTF's so their feedback would be valuable. Whenever someone was done with their testing, they gave us feedback which we wrote down to use in our presentation at the end of the semester. The overall feedback was that the challenges were fun and mostly balanced, but that there were too many challenges for them to solve in one day. We didn't really see this as a problem since it would be allowed to have up to four members a team. In addition, we would consider making the whole event a two-day event. This should give everyone more than enough time to go over and possibly solve every challenge. Some users also said that a few challenges where a bit too far-fetched, but that was depending on the user. Besides that we thought that a few hard challenges are necessary in a CTF event.</p>
						<p>When all our test users were done and the user testing report was finished, we realized that there was still one important thing missing in our documentation. We were missing a single document with all the solutions to the challenges. We all knew the method of solving the challenges that we had created ourselves, but didn't have it written down somewhere. So we made a single document and we each put in how to solve the challenges that we created.</p>
						<p>At the end of the day we had our daily meeting with our mentor. We showed him our end result and told him what we did on the last day. Just like us he seemed happy with our project. After five days of hard work we are very proud of what we accomplished, and we look forward to showcasing our project to the teachers.</p>
