						<p>We started the third day of with finishing some more complex challenges that we initially began working on during the previous day. We spend some time fine-tuning a few challenges from earlier days and tested a couple that had not been tested before.
In the morning, we mainly split our attention between two projects before lunch. Finishing the website of the blog and working on challenges, what resulted in 6 more challenges during that timeframe.</p>
						<p>During that time, we also had to change a challenge we had been working on, because It didn’t look feasible to complete within a reasonable timeframe.
In the afternoon we worked on setting up our first web challenge with a manually created backend, two more cryptography challenges, one Forensics challenge, and we started working on a Linux-based Reverse engineering challenge. During the afternoon we had quite a bit of bad luck with technical problems, and it delayed the progress of the day quite a bit. Over the course of the day we completed almost 10 new challenges, improved a few old ones and started working on a few more.</p>
						<p>We closed the day out with a meeting with our mentor, but because of the difficulties encountered during the afternoon, we still had some patch work to do in the evening.
